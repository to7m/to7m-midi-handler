COMPILABILITY:
    _io should be initialised first
    then controllers_profiles and sound_modules_profiles
    then _core

    turn this into diagram


TMHM recording:
    By default include all lsmp and lcp states, but have other options for just one controller etc.
    Figure out time sync.
    lcp_i translation on playback: create new lcps so playback is done by headless lcp by default

move all msgs and handlers into correct place



I think the way to tdo this derirdings things i sto record everything including the prerecorded stuff already playing, but then go back to the resultings fule and strip those parts out of it, but measure their relative offsets to the origisnal file and find the mediam dfferemce. then put then back in

LCP 0 should be for recorded only
when recording, LCP should be stored for the tmp file, but then after recording is complete, the recordings manager should separate the lcp0 stream and adjust the timestamps based on median diff. then combine with other streams removing LCP information



msg flow:
lcp sends using either send_to_core_global or send_to_core_for_pslot callable
callable created by connection manager, wrap the message in a LcpsToCoreGlobalMsg or LcpToCoreMsg

need a TmhStateMsg for future-proof playback, either:
  GlobalAndPslotsState (include next recording msg index)
  or
  PslotsState
  depending on what the recording contains

how to handle stop playback during recording? order of events


state:
    (msg_count, all state msgs)




flow:

lcp --> core:
  StartRecordingMsg()
  StopRecordingMsg()
  StartPlaybackMsg()
  StopPlaybackMsg()
  IncrementSelectedRecording(increment=1)
  DeleteRecordingMsg()
lcp should specify filename stems, because that means the lcp has more control


scenes which run entirely on the lcp
